Data Reduction Walkthrough
==========================

Input Data
----------
For this walkthrough we'll use a set of highly contrived fake Stokes images generated by CryoNIRSP's fake data script,
``cryo_fake_data``. Unfortunately, the script requires some files that are too large to include in the code repository.
Ask A. Eigenbrot for a set of fake data.

PolCal Data
-----------
We'll also need a set of CryoNIRSP data from a PolCal run. This can be generated by the
`PA&C Modules' <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/pac-pipeline/src/master/>`_, which you should have installed already:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pac_fake_data -I cryo-ci -C efficient_CS raw
  ...
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000000.000000_0.fits
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000001.000000_1.fits
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000002.000000_2.fits
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000003.000000_3.fits
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000004.000000_4.fits
  CRYONIRSP_20160523T000005.000000_5.fits
  ...

(If you're reducing CI data then change the argument to ``-I`` to be `cryo-ci`)

Setup
-----
Now let's create a default config file:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir rdx
  $ cd rdx
  $ cryo_pipeline -d ../raw config.ini

The ``-d`` flag populates a file with sensible defaults given a raw data directory:

.. code-block:: ini

  [Main]
  raw_sci_dir = ../raw
  output_prefix = Sci
  dark_cal = DarkCal
  gain1_cal = Gain1Cal
  lamp_gain_cal = LampCal
  gain4_cal = Gain4Cal
  align3_cal = Align3Cal
  instrument_pol_cal = InstPolCal
  linearize = False

  [DarkCalibration]
  raw_dark_dir = ../raw

  [Gain1Calibration]
  raw_gain1_dir = ../raw

  [LampGainCalibration]
  raw_lamp_dir = ../raw

  [Gain4Calibration]
  raw_gain4_dir = ../raw

  [Align3Calibration]
  raw_align3_dir = ../raw
  raw_pinhole_dir = ../raw

  [InstrumentPolarization]
  raw_pol_dir = ../raw
  threads = 3
  cu_numbins_x = 1
  cu_numbins_y = 1
  demod_numbins_x = 4
  demod_numbins_y = 4

Run
---
This is the easy part, just call the pipeline

.. code-block:: console

  $ cryo_pipeline config.ini

The CryoNIRSP Pipeline produces a lot of status messages and it is usually a good idea to save these somewhere so you can see exactly
what was done to the data at a later time (and find any error messages). To do this I usually run the pipeline as

.. code-block:: console

  $ cryo_pipeline config.ini 2>&1 | tee spool.txt

On most systems this will cause your terminal (stdout) to update much less frequently than usual. This is due to how
python decides to flush its buffer to stdout. If you want to save a spool file *and* get real-time status messages then
you need to set the environmental variable `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=yes`. You can even be real fancy and try:

.. code-block:: console

  $ PYTHONUNBUFFERED=yes cryo_pipline config.ini 2>&1 | tee spool.txt

Output Data
-----------
If you followed the steps above then you should have a directory that looks like this:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ls -1
  config.ini
  DarkCal.fits
  DarkCal_unc.fits
  Gain1Cal.fits
  Gain1Cal_unc.fits
  InstPolCal.fits
  Sci.fits
  polcal_proc_CI
  spool.txt

The reduced Science data live in ``Sci.fits``. The ``*Cal`` files are the intermediate Calibration objects. All
``*_unc.fits`` files are the pixel uncertainties associated with the parent file. The ``polcal_proc_CI`` directory is
where some extra reductions for the Instrument Polarization Calibration live.

Hopefully your reduced Science frame looks something like below
