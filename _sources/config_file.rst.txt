Configuration File Format
=========================

The CryoNIRSP Pipeline configuration file is in the standard INI format and contains the following sections and options. Any
options in *italics* are optional.

.. note::
   It is OK to put science and calibration data all into the same directory. The specific task (Dark, Gain, Observation,
   etc.) is determined from the `DKIST004` header value.

Main
----
This section controls the top-level Science reduction. All of the \*_cal options point to files that will not exist
on the first run of the pipeline. Once these objects have been created a lot of time can be saved by reusing them for
any other science runs that have the same setup. It is also possible to regenerate only a subset of the intermediate
Calibration Objects by simply pointing the corresponding option to a file that doesn't exist.

.. note::
   All of the \*_cal objects can be specified with or without their file extensions

:raw_sci_dir: Path to the directory containing raw CryoNIRSP frames to be reduced.

:output_prefix: The prefix to apply to all Level-1 science products. This string can also include a path structure.

:dark_cal: The location of a processed Dark Calibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:gain1_cal: The location of a processed Gain 1 Calibration object. If it does not exist it will be generated.

:instrument_pol_cal: The location of the Instrument Polarization Calibration object (i.e., demodulation matrices. If
    it does not exist it will be generated.

:*remove_TM*: **(bool)** [*True*] If `False` then do not apply a polarimetric correction for M1 - M6 (inclusive)

:*include_M12*: **(bool)** [*True*] If `False` then do include mirrors M1 and M2 in the telescope polarimetric correction. This
    option is only used if ``remove_TM`` is `True`

:*remove_parallactic*: **(bool)** [*True*]If `False` then do not include a final rotation into a common Solar reference frame.
    This option is only used if ``remove_TM`` is `True`.

:*telescope_db*: [*None*] The path to a telescope mirror parameter database. If none is provided then the default PA&C database
    will be used.

DarkCalibration
---------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.dark_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_dark_dir: The location of a directory containing raw dark frames. If ``Main.dark_cal`` does not exist then this
    directory must contain dark frames or an error will be thrown.

Gain1Calibration
----------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.gain1_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_gain1_dir: The location of a directory containing raw frames for the Gain1 task.

InstrumentPolarization
----------------------
This section will only be used if the file specified by ``Main.instrument_pol_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_pol_dir: The location of a directory containing raw files associated with a single PolCal Calibration Sequence (CS)

:*threads*: **(int)** [*1*] The number of CPU threads to use when performing basic CryoNIRSP reductions on the CS steps
